Be Eye
================
Let's consider that you want to find a certain object in your house.
First, you move to the area where it is likely to be. Then, you use your sense of sight to locate the object.
Even for us, who possess all the necessary faculties, this simple task sometimes requires a lot of time and effort.
However, for visually impaired individuals, this process is always a challenging task. To alleviate this difficulty faced by visually impaired individuals, we have developed an app called BE Eye.

Usage
----------------
1. Turn on your app, and insert the object you want to detection
- You can insert your object with normal keyboard, voice and talk back key board.
